# reviews-of-projects
This is a python code which scrapes the sourceforge.net website to get the customer reviews on projects.
Reviews on each project are stored in its separate .txt file.
This code was useful in performing sentiment analysis on the reviews given by customers on each open source project on sourceforge.net.
